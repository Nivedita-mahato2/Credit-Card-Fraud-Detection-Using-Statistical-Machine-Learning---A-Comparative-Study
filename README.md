# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Statistical-Machine-Learning---A-Comparative-Study
As machine learning and data mining techniques are widely utilized to deal with cyber-criminal cases, researchers often use those models to determine credit card fraud activities as well. In many literature Machine learning techniques like support vector machine, Naive Bayes, Artificial neural network, decision tree has been used in credit card fraud detection. This paper seeks to perform statistical analysis on the credit card dataset and utilize logistic regression and Random forest technique and evaluate their performance on credit card fraud data.
